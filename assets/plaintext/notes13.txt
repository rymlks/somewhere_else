Hey, I know I said some harsh things back there.

I know an apology isn't going to help, but I'm sorry either way.

I just can't keep my thoughts straight. Everything is so confusing.

I just want people to see the world the way I do.

It's frustrating. Confusing. Irrational, yet somehow consistently so.

There's a whole society where people interact with each other and understand each other so easily.

Everything is hard for me to understand.

But because everything is so hard to understand, nothing seems impossible.

I have to do impossible things every day, just to get through the moment of meeting an acquaintance or ordering a meal.

Creating a whole new universe is no harder than calling my mother.

What if I could make everyone else see things the way I do?

What if I could make everything confusing?

What if I could make everything possible? Not just for me. For you, too.

What if I could inspire people?

It seems impossible, but what else is there to do?
