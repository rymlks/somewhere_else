I just saw it one day.

The other side of the universe.

I was sitting there in my bedroom listening to some garbage, and there it was.

It was so far off in the distance, you could barely find it.

But it was there. I could see it. Everything around me was connected to it.

Everywhere I look I can see it now.

It couldn't be done, but

I did it.

Have you ever looked up at the stars on a dark night out in the forest?

Where there's no screen between you and the vastness?

It's worse than the ocean.

I know if I fall into the depths, some day I'll reach the bottom and be scavanged by the creatures of The Deep.

Out there though... Nothing will ever find me.

A place so vast it erases your very existence.

Gone from history. Gone from the future. Consciousness... wasted.

When I could see it that first time though, it was so... unfathomable.

In the midst of something this terrifying, all you can do is laugh.

It's nonsense. An overflow of emotion that comes around to the other side.

I hesitate to say what it is that I truly saw out there.

If we live here in the realm of God...

I could see somewhere...
else...
