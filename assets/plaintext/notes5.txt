Sometimes I have a thought and it's gone in an instant.
I have to keep track of every thought I have.
What's the point, if my thoughts just...
die?

Maybe I'm just not the kind of person who was born to be creative.

Maybe I'm just not the kind of person who was born to work really hard.

Maybe I'm just not the kind of person who was born to solve great problems.

Maybe I'm just not the kind of person who was born to perform.

Maybe I'm just not the kind of person who was born to make people laugh.

Maybe I'm the kind of person who was just born to solve trivial problems for nobody.

Maybe I'm the kind of person who was just born to sit at a desk and be quiet

Maybe I'm the kind of person who was just born to waste away on nothing interesting.

Just simple thoughts for myself.

It's not so bad, is it?

I've never thought a more chilling thought.

Perhaps life is good. Perhaps I am the kind of person who can live without worry.
Perhaps I'm the kind of person who can do anything and nobody will care.
Nobody could even know to care.

It can't be that bad can it?

Shouldn't it be bad?

Shouldn't life be suffering?

Shouldn't I create works of art?
Shouldn't I toil until the daylight to make something of myself?
Shouldn't I solve great problems, if I can find them?
Shouldn't I perform? Shouldn't I make jokes?

You wouldn't laugh.

You'll be dead like the rest of us.
Just like me.
Just like everyone we know. Both of us.

I'll laugh for you.
I'll try anyways.

What else is there to do?
