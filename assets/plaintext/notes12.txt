What, you were expecting a relatable framing story?

Fuck you.

Get out of my stupid fucking game and leave me alone.

I'm a dead man. If you want to be like me, you know what to do.

...

I never should have come here.

Nobody wants to hear what I have to say.

Nobody wants to see what I have to show.

Those who do are either deranged or moronic.

Why did I invite you here?

Why did I even make this place?

I'm so lost...

I'm so...
Forget it.

Just go. Let me be alone in this awful place forever.
