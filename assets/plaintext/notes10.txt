I'd like to be a musician.

I don't think I'd pass the entrance exam though. I can't sing about relationships.

Well, I guess it's not that I can't. I won't.

Aren't you tired of hearing the same story, over and over?

Don't you want something new?

I can't stand to hear so many tales of lovers and heated moments and heart break and "you (nameless girl) are the only beautiful and perfect girl I hAve EvEr MeT aNd YoU cAn PrEtEnD tHiS sOnG iS aBoUt YoU bEcAuSe It'S ABOUT NOBODY EXCEPT THE LOVELY AND ALL KNOWING BOARD OF MARKET RESEARCH AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH"

Give me a break...

God, I sound like my father.

I guess that's what everything is about anyways.

You'll never hear my story unless there's a horribly formulaic romance shoehorned in.

"Oh goodness I wonder if he'll ever reach her heart!?!?? I'll have to pay to see the next season in case he does!"
