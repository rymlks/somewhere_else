I get the sense that I'm a completely unrelatable person.
It must be me, right? I feel like I can't relate to anybody.
Nobody feels the world the way I do. 

They do it better.

I mean, other people are happy with their jobs and their lives and stuff.
Other people have dreams and they go for it. I go for it and get nowhere.

It's clearly my fault, I just don't know how to do better.
