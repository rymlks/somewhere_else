What if I did learn?

What if I could learn?

To do anything? To go anywhere?

What if I just became a shadow of a great person.

Could I become someone else?

Could I go somewhere else?

I tried once.

I was a popular man.

I made jokes with colleagues.

I made works of art.

I performed for moderate crowds.

I was a husk of a man, but I could do anything.

I used to try so hard to act however I thought was best.

And it worked.

It really did.

I promise, I'm not making this up. It worked. Try it for yourself.

Please, try it.

Please, listen to me. Nobody listens to me anymore, but I have to tell everyone somehow.

I forgot how.

I don't know what happened.

In an instant it was all gone, but I did it once. I'll do it again.

You can do it too.

Try.

Seriously, try it. I'm not bullshitting you. It really worked.

I'll invent an entire universe to tell you if I have to.

I'll toil every day for it all to make sense again if I have to.

Please, listen.

I can't argue, I never learned.

I'll show you.

I'll make something you'll never learn to understand.

But you have to understand.

You have to learn. And when you do, you'll see what it all means.
