crimbolini was a beatiful lonely princess who was also quirky and funny and independant but men just never understood her

"hey" she would say to hot but still sensitive dudes who treat women right and they would only say "hey" back.

woe.

One day Jumbibob mcDuke rode in on a chariot and he fell in love with crimbolini

"I'll sing a song for you" said Jumbibob.
"youuu are the most pretty and speciallllll girlllll in the worllllllllld and i love uuuuuuuuuu"
he sang, beautifally (and with perfect pitch also)

but the prinecss said no

he cried (but also remained strong by listening to his favorite band but he didnt know it was her favorite band too omgggggg)

jumbibob was also good at sports.
