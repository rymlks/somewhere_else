Its hard to find beauty in same sunrise every morning.
I wake up and I see the same road stretch off into the horizon,
terminating at the massive red ball of flames that is the sun.

Every morning the same thing. I get out of bed and I walk to my door.
It faces the outside.

I turn around and look back at my room. Yet another night of thrashing
and turning. Yet another morning of wistful disarray.

The sunrise blinds me from across the room through my window.
I never learn.

I turn towards the kitchen. The world collapses in front of me
into a paper thin compressed space within the wall of my room.

As the world begins to flatten, the tile walls of my kitchen spring 
forth from the same wall that is shared between my bedroom and the
humid summer.

The world passes me by in an instant, and I am now in my kitchen, 
standing in the doorway which leads to the outside, and to my room.

I make eggs. 

I hate eggs.
